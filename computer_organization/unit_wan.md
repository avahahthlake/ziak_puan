### Structure of a digital computer...💻
A digital computer is based on five main functional units
  * input unit -> The input unit takes data and instruction from the external world through input devices like keyboards, mouse, and other peripherals
  * output unit -> This output unit presents the results of the computer's processing to the user through devices such as monitors or printers
  * memory unit -> This stores instruction and data. It includes primary memory and secondary memory
  * arithmetic and logic unit -> This part of the computer performs all logical and arithmetic operations
  * control unit -> This unit directs the entire control flow of the computer.


### Computer - A general purpose machine 📠
The digital computer we use today is a general purpose machine because, to put it simply it can run 
different kinds of programs ranging from games to scientific tools and it is also capable of
providing multimedia and all. In the early years of computer, a computer was able to do one specific
thing and that's it. But that changed.

### Views of a computer 🪟
#### machine/assembly programmer's view
A machine/assembly language programmer views software at its lowest level, dealing 
directly with the CPU instruction.
  Features are...
  * Direct hardware interaction -> programs manipulate hardware registers, memory and
  IO ports directly.
  * Abstraction level -> Abstraction is at a very low level. Assembly is a one to one
  mapping to machine code instructions.
  * Focus on CPU -> Understanding the CPU architecture (registers and instruction set)
  is very very important.
  * Performance and speed -> Code is written for performance and maximum speed.
  * Code is processor specific and not easily moved between different CPU families.
#### computer architect's view
A computer architect views the computer as ***layers of abstraction***, balancing cost,
performance and power to design the system's logical structure and organization.
  Keys aspects of architect's view of computer...
  * Instruction set, data types and addressing
  * control signals, circuits and microarchitecture.
  * ***Instruction set architecture***
#### system logic designer's view
The system logic designer views the computer as an entity made up of logic gates,
that directly operate on binary values. They focus on abstract flow of data and
functional blocks like adders, subtractors, etc.

### Machine, machine languages and digital logic...
### Classification of computers and their instructions
### Simple RISC Computer (SRC)
