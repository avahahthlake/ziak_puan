A computer instruction set is a complete list of commands that a processor can
understand and execute to perform tasks.

## Key components of the instruction set

* Machine Language -> The fundamental language the cpu(processor) understands
* Opcode -> The part of the instruction that specifies the operation to be performed.
Examples are ... ADD, SUBTRACT, LOAD, SHIFT, BRANCH, etc...
* Operand -> The part of the instruction that specifies the data or location to be used
by the operation.
